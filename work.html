The work blends structured and improvised elements, allowing the performance to shift in response to the evolving sound-image interaction. Microscopic acoustic traces are captured and transformed through live electronics, creating a sonic environment as if the instrument’s physical structure had shifted.<br><br>Real-time visuals are generated through a custom particle system of roughly 500,000 spheres, forming geometries that shimmer, blur, and drift. Through live performance and responsive electronics, Velarium constructs an imaginary acoustic space where sound becomes visible and image becomes audible.<br><br>A key aspect of the project is the three-part performance ecosystem linking acoustic sound, processed audio, and real-time visuals. Each component listens and reacts to the others: audio drives the visuals, visuals trigger or modulate electronic processes, and performers adapt their playing in response to the resulting images and electronic sound. This creates a multi-layered interaction that makes each performance unique.<br><br>Created and performed using: Max/MSP/Jitter, Max for Live, Ableton Live, with a Schertler contact microphone<br><br>Harpsichord: Liubov Titarenko<br>Live electronics and visuals: Yu Oda<br><br>Premiered November 22, 2025<br>Het Orgelpark, Amsterdam<br>Prix Annelie de Man Festival</p></div><div class="video-item" data-category="featured ensemble acoustic Dowland"><h4 class="video-title">Route to Mute</h4><lite-youtube videoid="9qwAvWnnUgQ" playlabel="Route to Mute"></lite-youtube><p class="video-description">A composition that showcases the art of deconstruction, arrangement, and recreation, as part of the "Dowland series" that draws on existing music materials from works by John Dowland. The piece serves as a nod to the Renaissance song "If my complaints could passions move." Through this series, the composer aims to reinvigorate and reinterpret these classic works by reworking them in unique ways. "Route to Mute" is a reflection of this approach, offering a glimpse into the creative process behind the Dowland series and the composer's efforts to put their own spin on the original material.<br><br>Performed by New European Ensemble<br>Premiered on November 18th, 2022<br>Nieuwe Kerk, Den Haag</p></div><div class="video-item" data-category="featured electronics PL"><h4 class="video-title">May Remain</h4><lite-youtube videoid="clIOovnyCA4" playlabel="May Remain"></lite-youtube><p class="video-description">Electroacoustic work for Positive Organ, vibraphone, and electronics.<br><br>The detailed acoustic sounds of the organ and the vibraphone are captured with various types of microphones (contact, condenser, and pickup system) and processed with analog electronics (effect pedals and modular synth).<br><br>Co-commissioned by Gaudeamus Muzeiweek and Het Orgelpark and premiered in 2021.
