The work blends structured and improvised elements, allowing the performance to shift in response to the evolving sound-image interaction. Microscopic acoustic traces are captured and transformed through live electronics, creating a sonic environment as if the instrument’s physical structure had shifted.<br><br>Real-time visuals are generated through a custom particle system of roughly 500,000 spheres, forming geometries that shimmer, blur, and drift. Through live performance and responsive electronics, Velarium constructs an imaginary acoustic space where sound becomes visible and image becomes audible.<br><br>A key aspect of the project is the three-part performance ecosystem linking acoustic sound, processed audio, and real-time visuals. Each component listens and reacts to the others: audio drives the visuals, visuals trigger or modulate electronic processes, and performers adapt their playing in response to the resulting images and electronic sound. This creates a multi-layered interaction that makes each performance unique.<br><br>Created and performed using: Max/MSP/Jitter, Max for Live, Ableton Live, with a Schertler contact microphone<br><br>Harpsichord: Liubov Titarenko<br>Live electronics and visuals: Yu Oda<br><br>Premiered November 22, 2025<br>Het Orgelpark, Amsterdam<br>Prix Annelie de Man Festival</p></div><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>Route to Mute</h4><lite-youtube videoid=9qwAvWnnUgQ playlabel="Route to Mute"></lite-youtube><p class=video-description>A composition that showcases the art of deconstruction, arrangement, and recreation, as part of the "Dowland series" that draws on existing music materials from works by John Dowland. The piece serves as a nod to the Renaissance song "If my complaints could passions move." Through this series, the composer aims to reinvigorate and reinterpret these classic works by reworking them in unique ways. "Route to Mute" is a reflection of this approach, offering a glimpse into the creative process behind the Dowland series and the composer's efforts to put their own spin on the original material.<br><br>Performed by New European Ensemble<br>Premiered on November 18th, 2022<br>Nieuwe Kerk, Den Haag<br></p></div><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>May Remain</h4><lite-youtube videoid=clIOovnyCA4 playlabel="May Remain"></lite-youtube><p class=video-description>Electroacoustic work for Positive Organ, vibraphone, and electronics.<br><br>The detailed acoustic sounds of the organ and the vibraphone are captured with various types of microphones (contact, condenser, and pickup system) and processed with analog electronics (effect pedals and modular synth).<br><br>Co-commissioned by Gaudeamus Muzeiweek and Het Orgelpark and premiered in 2021.

Seated at the center, the audience is surrounded by the four musicians and four loudspeakers positioned at each corner of the space. Two projection screens face each other on opposite sides.<br><br>The visuals are designed in a four-dimensional geometric space and react dynamically to the live audio input from the musicians. Though projected onto flat screens, the images are crafted to evoke a sense of four-dimensional space through the audience’s perception. A central artistic challenge lies in creating an environment that inspires this imaginative leap into higher-dimensional perception.<br><br>– Artistic Concept –<br>This project seeks to evoke the experience of four-dimensional space through a live multimedia performance that integrates four musicians, electronics, a surround speaker system, and projected visuals.<br><br>In this work, the fourth dimension refers to an abstract spatial dimension beyond our three-dimensional perception, distinct from time as described in physics. While our observable universe is composed of three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, some theories in physics, such as string theory, propose that the universe may consist of up to 11 dimensions. Although we cannot perceive these higher dimensions directly, they can be represented mathematically and projected into two-dimensional visual forms.<br><br>Designing visuals in four-dimensional space involves constructing virtual geometries and using algorithms, such as stereographic or perspective projection, to convert them into two-dimensional representations. This process creates the illusion of depth and complexity that extends beyond the conventional three dimensions.<br><br>Time (understood not only as the motion of visual elements but also as the unfolding of music and sound) is a crucial part of the experience. It contributes to the perception of dimensionality by shaping how changes and relationships unfold over time.<br><br>The aim of the project is to closely connect visual and sonic aspects, without any hierarchy between music and image. They are presented as a unified entity, and the same principle applies to acoustic and electronic sounds. Performers interact not only with their instruments but also with the sounds from the speakers and the images on the screens, treating all elements as part of a single ensemble. The result is an immersive environment designed to stimulate the imagination and invite the audience into a conceptual experience of higher-dimensional space.<br><br>Violin - Paul Pankert / Ensemble 88<br><br>Premiered September 2024<br>Eupen, Belgium<br></p></div><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>Grain Threshold</h4><lite-youtube videoid=510cm-aN1ko playlabel="Grain Threshold"></lite-youtube><p class=video-description>Audiovisual work combining vibraphone’s electroacoustic sounds and morphing audio-reactive particles rendered with the ray marching technique.<br><br>Music performed by Plastiklova:<br>Vibraphone: Laurent Warnier (percussionist)<br>Organ & Electronics: Yu Oda (composer)<br><br>Made with Ableton Live and Max Jitter.</p></div></div><h3>Ensemble Works</h3><div class=video-grid><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>The Scheme of the Sea Organ</h4><lite-youtube videoid=ViuTh3khS9Q playlabel="The Scheme of the Sea Organ"></lite-youtube><p class=video-description>Composition for three Paetzold recorders, bass clarinet, and percussion (two performers), inspired by the Sea Organ (Morske orgulje) in Zadar.

While this higher dimension cannot be directly visualized, mathematics allows us to project its effects into three-dimensional space. Here, the fourth dimension is portrayed as a purely spatial axis, distinct from the concept of time in relativity (though, by combining dynamic motion and sound, the simulation could be interpreted as a 5D experience).<br><br>This simulation translates the fourth dimension into a dynamic visual experience. Using stereographic projection, it maps a series of stacked 3D grids into a comprehensible 3D space. The camera navigates through these layers, dynamically shifting depth and focus along the fourth-dimensional axis (w-axis). This creates an otherworldly perspective that evolves as you explore higher-dimensional space.<br><br>Two gravitational points — a black hole and a white hole — introduce localized distortions that ripple through the grid, dynamically reshaping the structure of spacetime. While not a full simulation of spacetime curvature as described by general relativity, these effects conceptually represent the bending of spacetime caused by massive objects in a higher-dimensional space.<br><br>Rendered in 8K and best experienced with a VR headset at the highest resolution.<br>Created with Max Jitter with custom shaders</p></div><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>4D Grid and Perlin Noise</h4><lite-youtube videoid=D_Uz1t4Vkv4 playlabel="4D Grid and Perlin Noise"></lite-youtube><p class=video-description>3D visualization of a higher-dimensional grid and 4D Perlin noise, blending geometry with spatial depth as an experimental exploration of higher dimensions. Watch with a VR headset at the highest resolution for an immersive 4D experience.<br><br>Following the previous experiment, this project continues the exploration of a fourth spatial dimension—an axis beyond height, width, and depth. While the fourth dimension remains beyond direct human perception, mathematical techniques combined with VR technology allow its effects to be projected into our 3D space. Here, the fourth dimension is visualized as a purely spatial axis, distinct from the concept of time in relativity.<br><br>The simulation translates this higher-dimensional space into a visual experience using a hybrid stereographic projection method. The adjusted order of the algorithm further enhances dynamic transformations based on the camera’s position. This approach not only preserves structural clarity but also conveys true depth derived from the 4D distance.<br><br>The camera moves from outside the 4D grid world, navigating through the space in a higher-dimensional manner. It provides a clear overview of the grid's structure and how its appearance transforms, morphing based on the camera's position. The grid consists of 10 divisions per axis, forming 10,000 cells in total.<br><br>The grid world transforms into 4D Perlin noise, projected similarly into 3D. With VR’s enhanced depth perception, the noise patterns become more vivid and intuitive, heightening the immersive exploration of higher-dimensional forms.<br><br>The scene consists of 40,000 lines, which form both the grid world and the basis for the Perlin noise visualization. This shared structure allows an organic transformation between these two variations. These lines dynamically shift in visibility depending on their position—including their W coordinate—relative to the camera’s location and field of view.<br><br>For reference, the real-world scale of the simulated grid world can be theoretically calculated based on the IPD used for the VR projection. With this approach, the edge length of the grid in the scene is approximately 84 meters (168 meters along its diagonal).<br><br>Created with Max Jitter with custom shaders.<br><br>Music: "rificia" by Pastiklova:<br>Vibraphone: Laurent Warnier (percussionist)<br>Organ & Electronics: Yu Oda (composer)<br><br></p></div></div><h3>Web-Based Works & 4D Experiments</h3><div class=video-grid><div class=video-item><h4 class=video-title>Orthorealm Web Version</h4><a href=orthorealm.html target=_blank class=image-link><img data-image=orth alt="Orthorealm Web Version"></a><p class=video-description>Interactive web version of Orthorealm.<br><br>The work presents a continuously evolving spatial structure derived from four-dimensional geometry, rendered in real-time directly in the browser.<br><br>The visual system is built from instanced planar elements that are duplicated, permuted, and distributed in 4D space.
