You can view the interactive web test version <a href=orthorealm.html target=_new>here</a>. In the near future, I will be creating more interactive images that may incorporate audio from your microphone to test a web version of audio-reactive images. Please check back later.</p></article></section><section><article><h2>Orthorealm</h2><p>A recent multimedia project, <strong>Orthorealm</strong>, involving four instrumentalists, electronics, and four surrounding speakers, along with audio-reactive images projected onto two screens, was premiered in collaboration with Ensemble 88. These audio-reactive images were designed in a four-dimensional geometric space and synchronized with the orientation of the surrounding speakers. The image design consists of a few hundred planes, some perpendicular and others parallel to each other (or a deformed hypercube). The project's goal is to encourage the audience to envision the hyperdimensional space through the performance of this work.<br><br>To further encourage people to grasp the concept of projecting hyperdimensional images, I am creating a web version of this work on this website. Visitors will have control over the images, creating an illusion of traveling through hyperdimensional space. This web version will continue to improve in the near future, but for now, the test version is available.</p><p><a href=orthorealm.html>"Orthorealm" Test Web Version</a> - click, drag, and scroll to control<br><a href=orthorealmHQ.html>"Orthorealm" Web HQ Version</a> - if your device can handle more<br><a href=hyperCubeDemo.html>What do you mean hyperdimension?</a> - Just to demonstrate how a hyperdimensional cube known as "tesseract" would look like</p></article></section><section><article><h2>NoiseSample at ISCM</h2><p>I'm delighted to announce that my multimedia work, <strong>NoiseSample</strong>, has been chosen to represent the Netherlands' section at this year's ISCM (International Society of Contemporary Music) event in South Africa. The work was previously published online in early 2023 and will have its public performance premiere in Johannesburg. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to discuss my recent works during the festival at a local institution. I am looking forward to being part of this event and connecting with fellow artists.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/yleTrE61UQg?si=UySqpaTjCrvAgoWC" target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">"NoiseSample" on Youtube</a></p></article></section><section><article><h2>A New Work Premiered by New European Ensemble</h2><p>I am more than happy to share a premiere of my recent composition, <strong>Route to Mute</strong>, which was performed by the New European Ensemble conducted by Ivan Buffa last November. The piece draws inspiration from and is based on John Dowland's "If my complaints could passions move," and I feel it may be one of the last works in my “Dowland Series”, which I have been developing for over a decade.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/9qwAvWnnUgQ?si=YWksZnQeEpKAqdi0" target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the premiere of "Route to Mute"</a></p></article></section><section><article><h2>Plastiklova Album Release</h2><p>Plastiklova, an electroacoustic music with my colleague Laurent Warnier, is proud to announce the release of a mini DIY album, now available on various streaming platforms. This album features our recent works, incorporating vibraphone, electronics, analog synthesizers, and a few other percussion instruments. We've used our own way to compose, recorde, edit, coded the music video, and even create the album artwork ourselves!</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/CwIJ0GPbNfI?si=zjKbeZMtOZTOP8nP" target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Video "Grain Threshold" from the Album</a><br><a href=https://tr.ee/sTaOpBVXQK target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen to the Album on Various Platforms</a></p></article></section><footer><a href=index.html class=nav-button>home</a> <a href=about.html class=nav-button>about</a> <a href=work.html class=nav-button>work</a> <a href=agenda.html class=nav-button>agenda</a> <a href=contact.html class=nav-button>contact</a><br><p class=bottom>Feb 2026 | <a href=https://www.instagram.com/oda_comp/ target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> | <a href=https://www.youtube.com/odayu21/ target=_new rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> | <a href=privacy.html>Privacy</a></p></footer></main></body></html>
